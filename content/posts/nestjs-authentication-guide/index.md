# Conclusion

In this guide, we implemented a basic authentication system using NestJS and MikroORM. We covered setting up the environment, configuring the database, creating a user model, and implementing sign-up, sign-in, and profile endpoints. While the system is simple and doesn't include advanced features like email verification or token refresh, it's a solid foundation for building more complex auth workflows.

Feel free to expand on this by adding features such as role-based access control, refresh tokens, or integration with external identity providers.
