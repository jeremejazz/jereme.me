In this tutorial, we’ll walk through how to create a custom map using a large image in [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/), a lightweight JavaScript library for building interactive maps in web applications.

This technique is useful when working with non-geographical maps or images that you want to make interactive, zoomable, and possibly annotated.

## Why Use Custom Maps?

There are several scenarios where using a custom image as a map makes sense:

- **Indoor Maps**: This is a common use case—think of malls, airports, or exhibition halls where a visual indoor layout helps visitors navigate.
- **Video Game Maps**: Many games come with expansive in-game worlds. Custom maps allow for interactive player guides. For example, [The Forest Map](https://theforestmap.com/) provides an interactive map for players of _The Forest_ game.
- **Zoomable Images**: You’re not limited to maps. If you have a large image, such as a blueprint, artwork, or infographic, you can use Leaflet to let users zoom into specific areas without loading the entire image at once. You can even add markers or annotations for more context. (ex. ESO’s 9-gigapixel [zoomable image of the Milky Way galaxy](https://www.eso.org/public/images/eso1242a/zoomable/), even though this is using HTML5 canvas, you can also make something similar using Leaflet. )
